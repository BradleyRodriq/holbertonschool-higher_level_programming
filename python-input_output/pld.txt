Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **Why Python programming is awesome**:
   - Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.
   - It has a vast standard library and active community support.
   - Python supports multiple programming paradigms and is widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, and automation.

2. **How to open a file**:
   - You can open a file using the `open()` function, specifying the file path and the mode (`'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing, `'a'` for appending, etc.).
   - Example: `file = open('filename.txt', 'r')`.

3. **How to write text in a file**:
   - After opening the file in write mode (`'w'`), you can use the `write()` method to write text to the file.
   - Example: `file.write('Hello, world!')`.

4. **How to read the full content of a file**:
   - After opening the file in read mode (`'r'`), you can use the `read()` method to read the entire content of the file into a string.
   - Example: `content = file.read()`.

5. **How to read a file line by line**:
   - After opening the file in read mode (`'r'`), you can use a loop to iterate over the file object, which will yield each line.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
         for line in file:
             print(line)
     ```

6. **How to move the cursor in a file**:
   - You can use the `seek()` method to move the cursor to a specific position in the file.
   - Example: `file.seek(0)` moves the cursor to the beginning of the file.

7. **How to make sure a file is closed after using it**:
   - You can use the `with` statement to ensure that a file is automatically closed after use.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
         content = file.read()
     ```

8. **What is and how to use the with statement**:
   - The `with` statement is used to simplify resource management by ensuring that a resource is properly cleaned up after use.
   - It is commonly used with file I/O operations to automatically close files after use, as shown in the previous example.

9. **What is JSON**:
   - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format.
   - It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

10. **What is serialization**:
    - Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be stored or transmitted.

11. **What is deserialization**:
    - Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized data structure back into its original form.

12. **How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string**:
    - You can use the `json.dumps()` function to serialize a Python data structure into a JSON string.
    - Example: `json_string = json.dumps(data)`.

13. **How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure**:
    - You can use the `json.loads()` function to deserialize a JSON string into a Python data structure.
    - Example: `data = json.loads(json_string)`.

14. **How to access command line parameters in a Python script**:
    - You can access command line parameters using the `sys.argv` list provided by the `sys` module.
    - Example: `import sys; script_name = sys.argv[0]; parameter1 = sys.argv[1]`.
